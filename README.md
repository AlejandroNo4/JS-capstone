This project is the Javascript capstone for Microverse.

This game is a turn-based RPG in which your objective is to rescue your teammates. To do it, you will be inside a robot vehicle. Trying to face those creatures without it would be suicide.

Collecting supplies will not only give you more power, but it will also give you a better score. Get to your teammates to win the game. Hint: they are on the other side of the map.
